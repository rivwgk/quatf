# quatf #

A quaternion implementation in Fortran using parameterised derived types for
single, double and quadruple precision IEEE-754 floating point numbers. Here
all the operations on quaternions are implemented by overloading the usual
operators (`+`, `-`, `*` and `/`), comparisons (`.eq.` and `.ne.`) and 
intrinsic functions (`conjg`, `abs`).
